1. Write the command `/settle_debt` to settle a debt with another member of the group.

2. Now, specify:
	* the member towards who you would like to pay your debt (this action displays the money you owe to that person);
	* you can either set `All (value)` or `Settle partially`

3. If you choose `Settle partially` then you need to insert the desired amount. Once paid, WeSplitBot will display the remaining amount.

4. If you choose `All (value)` then you will settle your entire debt.

5. If you have at least another debt, WeSplitBot will ask you if you would like to settle another one.

6. If there aren't any other debts you are settled.
