With the command `/settle_debt` you can settle a debt with another member of the group.

The first thing to do is choose with whom settle the debt. This action display the money you owe to that person.



Then you can press 'All (value)' or 'Settle partially' to settle the debt. 

If you choose 'Settle partially' then you need to insert the amount that you want to settle. 



Subsequently, the bot will display the amount yet to pay.



If you choose 'All (value)' then you settle all debt.


In another case, if you have at least another debt the command asks if you want to settle another one.


In the end when there aren't more debts to pay the command tells that you are settled.
