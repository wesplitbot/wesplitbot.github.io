1. Write the command `/settle_debt` to settle a debt with another member of the group.

2. Now, you specify:
	* with whom settle the debt (this action display the money you owe to that person);
	* if you want to set `All (value)` or `Settle partially`

3. If you choose 'Settle partially' then you need to insert the amount that you want to settle. Subsequently, the bot will display the amount yet to pay.

4. If you choose 'All (value)' then you settle all your debit.

5. If you have at least another debt the command asks you if you want to settle another one.

6. In the end when there aren't more debts to pay the command tells that you are settled.
