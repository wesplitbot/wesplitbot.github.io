1. Write the command `/edit_expense` to edit an expense.


2. Now, select the expense in the list that you want to edit by writing its number in the chat.

3. Then, choose the field that needs editing:
	* amount;
	* date;
	* category;
	* description;
	* who paid;
	* list of members who are supposed to share the expense;

4. Now, the edited expense should be visible in the chat.
